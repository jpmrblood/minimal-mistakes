excerpt: Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, precompiled OpenJDK patched
---

Oracle JDK 11 will no longer free for production use. People will have to use OpenJDK. Also, patches will not be backported from Oracle JDK 11 to OpenJDK 11. It will be up to the community to backport the patches.

Well, this will be like Redhat's RHEL and CentOS.

TL;DR:
 * Buy Oracle license.
 * Use vendor's provided patched OpenJDK like [Azul OpenJDK](https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-and-zulu-enterprise/)
 * Use the CentOS' Java, [AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net)
