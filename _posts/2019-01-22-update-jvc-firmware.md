excerpt: Update JVC KW-M540BT

WARNING: after update, the Suzuki logo replaced by default JVC logo.

WARNING2: I'm not responsible for any use of this info. The responsibility is yours.

All New Ertiga 2018 GX uses JVC KW-M540BT. I like to have newest firmware for it. Latest revision tends to have better stability.

Turn on the engine before updating. This to ensure electricity.

Format USB to FAT32 first before.

To get the update:
* Go to [http://www.jvc.net/cs/car/firmware/2018/kwv640bt/](http://www.jvc.net/cs/car/firmware/2018/kwv640bt/)
* Click on *Agree* so that we could download the firmware
* Download *Model 2* [File "S_V1_1_1421_1100.zip" download (265 MB)](http://www.jvc.net/cs/car/firmware/2018/kwv640bt/software/S_V1_1_1421_1100.zip) 
* Unzip the folder to USB drive
* Plug the USB and it will automatically detect.
* Follow the screen instruction and everything will be done.

There would be several restarts on the update process.
