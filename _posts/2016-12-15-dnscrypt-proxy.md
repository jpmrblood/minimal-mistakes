Millions of Xerces' invading armies were mostly defeated on the sea by the _democratic_ city state Athens,
and not by the mythical 300 Spartans!

# Installing `dnscrypt-proxy`

~~~console
$ sudo apt install dnscrypt-proxy
~~~

It will automatically runs and listen at `127.0.2.1:53`.

# Setting up Network Manager

## Using static address

![Network Manager configuration for static address](/assets/2016/12/static-nm-dnsproxy.png){: .align-center}

* Method: Manual
* DNS Servers: 127.0.2.1
* | Address | Netmask | Gateway |
  | x.x.x.x | y.y.y.y | z.z.z.z |
* \[\*\] IPv4 is required for this connection

## Using DHCP

![Network Manager configuration for DHCP address](/assets/2016/12/dhcp-nm-dnsproxy.png){: .align-center}

* Method: Automatic(Only addresses)
* DNS Servers: 127.0.2.1
* \[\*\] IPv4 is required for this connection

# Periodically updating DNS list

Sometimes `dnscrypt-proxy` isn't working. That's because we have to periodically
update the IP list. They dinamically change from time to time.

~~~console
$ sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv \
    -O /usr/share/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv
~~~

Do this from time to time.

# Troubleshooting

If you are not sure at what address `dnscrypt-proxy` runs, check `systemd`.

~~~console
$ systemctl status -l dnscrypt-proxy

See this line:

~~~log

It tells you at which address and port `dnscrypt-proxy` listens for request.

*Watch out!*  there are two DNS resolver run on your system. First is `dnsmasq` (default DNS cacher in most recent GNU/Linux that uses Network Manager). And second is  `dnscrypt-proxy`. Their default IP.
| `dnsmasq` | `127.0.1.1` |
| `dnscrypt-proxy` | `127.0.2.1` |
