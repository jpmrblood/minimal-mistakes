excerpt: For those who do smart cards, we can use PCSCLite library. With Omnikey 5321 as reader, here's how we do it.

Installing necessary driver for Omnikey and install OCFPCSC driver for it.

# Driver Part

## Install PCSC and tools

```console
$ sudo apt install libpcsclite-dev pcscd pcsc-tools
```

## Install Omnikey Driver

Go to HID Global and download: [OMNIKEY 512X, 532X, 1021, 3X21, 6121 PCSC FOR LINUX X86_64](https://www.hidglobal.com/drivers?field_driver_brand_tid_selective=24&field_driver_product_reference_nid_selective=All&field_driver_operating_systems_tid_selective=All)

Actually, use Google and search for *ifdokrfid_lnx_x64-2.10.0.1* version. That is the most stable one in my years of experience. Last time I tested it, the new ones was not that relible. May be have change.

```console
$ tar xvfz ifdokrfid_lnx_x64-2.10.0.1.tar.gz && cd ifdokrfid_lnx_x64-2.10.0.1
$ sudo ./install -d /usr/lib/pcsc/drivers
```

And PCSCd should detect the reader. If not, go restart PCSCd

```console
$ sudo systemctl restart pcscd
```

Or, to debug PCSCd

```console
$ sudo systemctl stop pcscd
$ sudo pcscd -afd
```
Press CTRL+C to terminate it.

To check card:

```console
$ pcsc_scan
PC/SC device scanner

# Install Java SDK

```console
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

# Install OCFPCSC

Download OCF library from [OpenSCDP site](http://www.openscdp.org/ocf/download.html).

```console
$ wget http://www.openscdp.org/ocf/ocf-1.3.1916.zip
$ unzip ocf-1.3.1916.zip
$ cd ocf/jni/ocfpcsc
$ make JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
$ sudo cp libOCFPCSC1.so /usr/lib/libOCFPCSC1.so
```


Done. Now java app can access card.
