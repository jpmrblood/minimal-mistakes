excerpt: VirtualBox on a new machine from clone.
---

After cloning a VM template, we need to change things to make us stay out of trouble.

SSH to the machine and do these things.

# Machine ID

Change machine ID.

```bash
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
sudo rm /etc/machine-id
sudo systemd-machine-id-setup
sudo ln -s /etc/machine-id /var/lib/dbus/
```

# Hostname

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 newhost0" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newhost0
```
