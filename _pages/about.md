We often becomes more stupid than donkey. We fall on the same pit twice. We
seems like never ever really learn anything.

_Actually, we do learn!_

We learn the experience to gain understanding to do things better. Making our
ways better based on previous knowledge stored at a knowledge repository. We
learn new things every day. Making this knowledge repository an open world
assumption, semi structured.

This knowledge repository is a graph of knowledge with the possibility of
branching out. That's why it is so easy to add new knowledge, but so hard to
update an existing knowledge node. Just like a graph behave.

On an ideal graph, we only have to append new knowledge nodes. But a life's
knowledge node often have to rebalance and rewrite old nodes. This update of
link and unlink nodes often made our knowledge repository segfaulted at certain
branch of knowledge; making it contains factoid.

Another problem also arise from the way we process our knowledge. We are using
tacit knowledge stored on our short-term memory to process things up.

This short-term memory is limited and volatile. Some knowledge jumbled with the
wrong node. Again, another mislead factor in decision making.

To maintain that, we need an external storage. Turn the tacit into external
knowledge and vice versa. And this is what this website all about:

_Capturing tacit as fast as it could._ Like a RAM trying
to keep up with CPU registers.

This is impossible, of course. We need to buffer a faster stream before ended up
into the slower stream. Such buffer is also limited. Too long to buffer and the
next thing is the buffer overflowed.

To prevent buffer overflow and reduce the stress on that buffer, we need to
relax this site's writing format. Make it as fast as possible.

Thus, this site write almost raw.
